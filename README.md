### How to use these?

You first need to get my translation system (currently unreleased).
Download the one you want to use and add it to /var/www/pterodactyl and change the name of it to **lang.json**.
Type **yarn run build:production** wait for a few minutes and you are done!

# If you would like to add more languages or help with spelling problems be my guest!
