## How to use these?

* You first need to get my translation system (currently unreleased (:).
* Download the one you want to use and add it to /var/www/pterodactyl and change the name of it to **lang.json**.
* Follow [this guide](https://pterodactyl.io/community/customization/panel.html) and you are done!
